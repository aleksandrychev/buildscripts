To use this list:
1. rebuild openssl
2. look for "Enabled features:" in its output
3. compare it with this list, sorted and cleared.

To sort and clear this list:
sort enabled-features.txt | sed '/^ /!d;s/ - .*$//'

Explanation of options you can find at:
https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/INSTALL.md



These we need:
    autoalginit - required for shared build
    bulk - required to build any cyphers at all
    deprecated - build with support for deprecated APIs
    legacy - build the legacy provider (provides Blowfish which is used by the
	CFEngine legacy protocol when encryption is enabled - required for
	relevant unit tests)
    pic - required for shared library
    shared - build shared library, to be used by CFEngine
    dh - required to initiate TLS connections
    des - required, see https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/CFE-4034

Encryptions we use:
    bf
    tls
    tls1
    tls1-method
    tls1_1
    tls1_1-method
    tls1_2
    tls1_2-method
    tls1_3

These are nice to have:
    autoerrinit - load human readable error strings
    autoload-config - load system default openssl.cnf file.
    err - compile in error strings

These don't sound like something worth disabling:
    pinshared - pin the shared libraries.
    posix-io - use POSIX IO capabilities.
    rdrand - use hardware RDRAND capabilities.
    secure-memory
    sse2 - use SSE2 instructions
    static-engine - This only has an impact when not built "shared".
    stdio - use something from stdio.h
    threads - Build with support for multi-threaded applications.
    ssl - enabled despite no-ssl flag

These may be ok to disable:
    cached-fetch - cache algorithms when they are fetched from a provider
    makedepend - generate dependencies
    multiblock - build support for writing multiple records in one go in libssl
    nextprotoneg - Next Protocol Negotiation (NPN) TLS extension.

These are required by our dependencies (and maybe by us, too):
    cast - used by postgresql
    cms - used by php
    des - used by postgresql
    dh - used by postgresql
    ec - required by php, see https://github.com/php/php-src/issues/9064
    md4 - used by rsync and php
    ocsp - used by apache
    rmd160 - used by php, see https://github.com/php/php-src/issues/8430
    sock - used by curl?
